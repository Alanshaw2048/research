Contributing to Filecoin Research
=====

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Filecoin research endeavours!

**Disclaimer:** While we work hard to document our work as it progresses, research progress may not be fully reflected here for some time, or may be worked out out-of-band.

In general, Filecoin Research will favor focus over breadth of engagement, but we welcome any contributions. We've found that discussion and engagement with the underpinnings of Filecoin and helped shape these research efforts.

Here's how you can engage:

## Protocol Questions?

You may want to check out these sources:
- [The Filecoin spec](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs)
- [Filecoin slack](filecoinproject.slack.com)
- [Filecoin's Discussion Forum](discuss.filecoin.io)

Still haven't found an answer to your question? Open an issue, and tag it with `question`.

## Problems with Filecoin?

Have you found a problem with the Protocol?

Open an issue and tag it with `bug`. We would love to engage with you on it, and potentially start working together to solve it.

## Ideas for our `unsolved-problems`?

How exciting! Engage on the relevant issue and let's take our collaboration forward from there!

## New Ideas?

Share them with the community by opening up a new issue and tagging it with `idea/brainstorm`.
